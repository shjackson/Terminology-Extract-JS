# Terminology-Extract-JS
HTML/JS Version of Terminology Extractor with Excel Export

This a work utility I am developing for my localization/translation activities. The html interface asks the user to select a source file (in .docx format), extract key terms and export terms to Excel format.

Requires flask to run "term_extract_app.py" before using the html UI.

Current version is plain with no visual formatting. CSS coming in a future version.
